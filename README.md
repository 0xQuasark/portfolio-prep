A General Knowledge Quiz

It allows a user to select from a variety of options, and then asks the user some questions.

![Final Screen](<img/201. Final Screen.png>)
The questions are sourced from www.opentb.org, where there is over 4,000 curated questions.

![Leaderboard](<img/201. Leaderboard.png>)
One can even compete with other players (on the same computer) to see who's the biggest know-it-all!


## Salmon Cookies
This was a project that I built to experiment with CSS

I also wanted to dynamically HTML without using a framework or library, this is all hand injected code:
